Downloadable plugins README
===========================

The list of plugins available to download lives in ocpn-plugins.xml,
in the data/ directory. If available, the downloaded plugins uses
icons in the icons/ dir. These must be either svg (preferred) or
png; in the latter case big enough to be scaled reasonably.

The name if the icon matches the name in ocpn-plugins.xml, typically
without the \_pi suffix.
